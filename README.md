As a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student, I’m really passionate about technology and all the amazing things it can do. My fascination with how things work kicked off my journey into this field, and it’s been an exciting adventure ever since. I love diving into new areas, whether it's coding, exploring software development, or delving into Artificial Intelligence. I’m excited to share what I’m learning and working on with you!
